# About

Sometimes, I am asked to provide links to recordings of talks or interviews that I have given previously. This page helps me keep an overview. It is likely incomplete &mdash; additions and corrections are welcome.

Most of my talks are in English, and for those that are not, the slides (if there are any) are usually in English. Slides for most of my talks are available in public &mdash; see the overview [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Daniel_Mietchen/Talks). In the list below, I am just pointing to the URL of the slides, which should have a prominent mention of words like "listen" or "watch", "recording", "audio" or "video". If items on this list are not talks (e.g. an interview), this is indicated.
