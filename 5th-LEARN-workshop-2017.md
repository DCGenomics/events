# About
On January 26, 2017 in Barcelona, the [EU project LEARN (LEaders Activating Research Networks: Implementing the LERU Research Data Roadmap and Toolkit)](http://learn-rdm.eu/) are organizing their 5th workshop on Research Data Management, entitled “[Shaping and aligning research data management policies](http://learn-rdm.eu/workshops/5th-learn-workshop/)”, to which this document is a contribution.

# Title
Integrating policy and infrastructure in research data management: the perspective of researchers

# Abstract
As the interest in research data management is growing in many parts of the research ecosystem, policies and infrastructures are being put in place in a growing number of contexts. I will comment on these developments from the perspective of researchers who are supposed to abide by the policies and to use the infrastructures for their research. Drawing on examples from the ongoing Zika virus outbreak, I will pay special attention to policy and infrastructure elements that are facilitating or complicating research data management and explore avenues for standardization.
