# About
On January 26, 2017 in Barcelona, the [EU project LEARN (LEaders Activating Research Networks: Implementing the LERU Research Data Roadmap and Toolkit)](http://learn-rdm.eu/) are organizing their 5th workshop on Research Data Management, entitled “[Shaping and aligning research data management policies](http://learn-rdm.eu/workshops/5th-learn-workshop/)”, to which this document is a contribution. The workshop has been live streamed, and the videos [archived](http://www.ub.edu/ubtv/es/colleccio/congressos-i-jornades/5th-learn-workshop-shaping-and-aligning-research-data-management-policies). There have also been tweets under the [#learnbcn](https://twitter.com/hashtag/learnbcn?src=hash) hashtag.

# Title
Integrating policy and infrastructure in research data management: the perspective of researchers

# Abstract
As the interest in research data management is growing in many parts of the research ecosystem, policies and infrastructures are being put in place in a growing number of contexts. I will comment on these developments from the perspective of researchers who are supposed to abide by the policies and to use the infrastructures for their research. Drawing on examples from the ongoing Zika virus outbreak, I will pay special attention to policy and infrastructure elements that are facilitating or complicating research data management and explore avenues for standardization.

# Comments on previous talks
## [Paul Ayris](http://www.ub.edu/ubtv/es/video/delivering-research-data-management-in-the-ydata-deluge)
### Slides available?
### Discoverability
* see [this image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Open_Data_stickers.jpg) used in his talk

### Research cycle
* We should go beyond regarding publication as a (and even *one*) step within the research cycle, but start thinking about [publishing the research process](https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.1.e7547)

### Data availability
* some funders now require that data be kept for *10 years after last consultation*
* we should pay more attention to what should be deleted, and when (cf. CERN)

### Multitude of policies
* see slide 17 of Paul Ayris talk, which summarized Research funder policies relevant to University College London
* I'll [zoom in on that](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/talks/blob/master/5th-LEARN-workshop-2017.md#sharing-policies-relevant-to-nih)

## [Marie Timmermann](http://www.ub.edu/ubtv/es/video/developing-a-framework-for-research-data-management-protocols)
### Slides?
### Drivers of change
* Science Europe argues for a bottom-up approach to open science
* I think it's important that we encourage [all stakeholders to help advance open science](https://openscience.ub.uni-bielefeld.de/tag/stakeholders), be it bottom-up, top-down or otherwise

### DMP framework
* Framework was "submitted to several communities" but amongst the [search results for "DMP framework"](https://www.google.com/search?q=dmp+framework), none are obviously related to Science Europe?
* Using Data management plans to enforce policies
  - Not practical at the moment
  - Need to move towards machine readable DMPs that are versioned and public
  - I'll [zoom in](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/talks/blob/master/5th-LEARN-workshop-2017.md#data-management-plans) a bit here as well
* Domain Data Protocols?
  - only thing I found is slide 5 in [this presentation](http://ktu.edu/uploads/files/Bibliotekos/2016_12_6_Petrauskaite.pdf)
  
### Bureaucracy
* Open science is often perceived as yet another layer of bureaucracy
* Lots of bureaucratic procedures exist for reasons closely tied to the lack of transparency
* Look for opportunities to *reduce* bureaucracy by increasing openness and transparency

# Sharing policies relevant to NIH

* The [report on the strategic vision for the National Library of Medicine](http://acd.od.nih.gov/reports/Report-NLM-06112015-ACD.pdf) recommends that NLM should
   * "be a leader and innovator in open science efforts worldwide"
   * "lead efforts to support and catalyze open science, data sharing, and research reproducibility, striving to promote the concept that biomedical information and its transparent analysis are public"
   * and, in particular, "lead efforts to promulgate and implement best practices in open source, open science, standards, and data harmonization, forming partnerships across communities, stakeholder organizations, agencies, and countries" as well as "be an active participant in the design and oversight of programs that incentivize and celebrate the open sharing of data and resources."
* My [comments](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/datascience/blob/master/nlm-strategic-plan.md) on how to do this in practice.

## Interactions of policies 
* for every collaborator on a project
  - discipline-specific policies
  - journal-specific policies
  - policies regarding the sharing of data, databases, code, text, multimedia, patient information, sensitive information etc.
  - institution-specific policies
  - funder-specific policies
  - platform-specific policies
  - ethics
