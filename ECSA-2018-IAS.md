# About

This file hosts a submission to the European Citizen Science Association (ECSA) [conference](https://www.ecsa-conference.eu/) on 3-5 June 2018 in Geneva. It was submitted by the 21 January 2018 deadline under the "Scientific literacy" theme. On March 27, I was notified by the organizers that the session had been put on a waitlist:
> For now, we cannot include your contribution with the Title “A framework for co-creating citizen science projects with school students” (ID285) in our programme. However, if any of the slots should become available within the next few weeks we would be happy to contact you again.

# Title

A framework for co-creating citizen science projects with school students

# Abstract

"I'm a Scientist - get me out of here" is a science engagement platform that brings together school students in the UK with researchers from various disciplines in highly interactive online contexts. Inspired in style by some popular media formats, it is thematically centred around scientific literacy, the fascination of research, and the human aspects of being (or possibly becoming) a researcher. 

After running for several years with a range of schools, classes and researchers in "zones" focused on general science or specific subfields, a new variation was introduced in 2017: baptized the "Enquiry Zone", the idea here is to have students co-create citizen science projects in the subject domains of the zone's researchers, to vote on which of these potential projects they would like to realize, and to do so with guidance from the corresponding researcher.

Building on the experiences from 2017, another issue of the event will be run in March 2018, again with an "Enquiry Zone" focused on citizen science. In this presentation - which is to be given on the basis of https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/events/blob/master/ECSA-2018-IAS.md - I plan to summarize the outcomes.
