# Title

Wikimania in Africa - an opportunity for engaging communities of researchers, practitioners and Wikimedians

# Type of activity

Session: 30-45 min time slot 

# Abstract

Africa is often neglected in scholarly discourse, be it as a source of expertise, ideas, and technology or as a topic for study. Wikimania - the annual meeting of the people behind Wikipedia and its sister projects - will take place in South Africa in July 2018, hosted by the University of Cape Town. In this session, we want to explore ways in which this event could be used to catalyze new interactions between researchers, practitioners and Wikimedians from Africa and around the world.
