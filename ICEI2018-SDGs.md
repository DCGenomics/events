# About

The [10th International Conference on Ecological Informatics](http://icei2018.uni-jena.de/) is taking place on 24-28 September 2018 in Jena.

The call for proposals has an [April 15 deadline](http://icei2018.uni-jena.de/calls/), for which I am considering to submit the following abstract to the Session S3.6 "Efficient data and workflow management for reaching Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) targets associated to biodiversity and ecosystems", as sketched out in [this ticket](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/events/issues/339).

# Submission abstract

The targets and indicators associated with the Sustainable Development Goals form a complex network of relationships between policy and practice, aspirations and achievements across domains and around the globe. This poses challenges for monitoring, evaluating and communicating progress towards these goals.

In this presentation, we will explore how Wikidata and its semantic core Wikibase can be leveraged to represent the goals as well as the associated targets and indicators in a way that allows people to make use of that information in the language of their choice, in a given country or around the globe.
