# Title

Workshop: Integrating Wikidata with research and curation workflows

# Session description

Wikidata is a platform that brings together a global community of people from all walks of life - as well as tools of various degrees of automation - to engage in the collaborative collection and curation of structured data that is in the public domain. It is also multilingual, and has been described as the Rosetta stone of the linked open data age.

Launched in 2012, it has since become a hub for structured data across many domains of knowledge, including research fields from cultural heritage to biomedicine. Since its beginnings, the potential of integrating Wikidata with research and curation workflows has been explored through a number of activities, e.g. initiatives to collect on Wikidata information about paintings, pathways, politicians, proteins or publications as well as through workshops or grant proposals.

Data in Wikidata is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) by design, which opens up new perspectives in terms of the discoverability of research data, its incorporation into applications and education, and the potential to harness data curation efforts taking place in distant corners of the research data ecosystem for collaboration within and across fields.

This two-part workshop aims to introduce participants to Wikidata and to highlight how it can and does contribute to workflows in or near the participants' fields of research. It builds on similar workshops given in the past to various audiences — from librarians to economists to scientists and museum professionals — on how research workflows can be integrated with the workflows of Wikidata and its sister Wikimedia projects.

The workshop is arranged in two main parts:
- the first part is introductory and will provide the basics about Wikidata and the research and curation-related workflows around it;
- the second part is more hands-on, focusing on integrating some exemplary discovery and curation workflows with Wikidata, which will be drawn from SciDataCon abstracts and experiences shared by course participants.

Throughout the workshop, active participation by attendees will be encouraged through a discursive presentation style, quizzes and group work. At the end of the session, all participants are expected to have added some specific bits of knowledge to Wikidata, and to have reviewed contributions made by others.

This submission addresses all four of the [high-level themes of SciDataCon 2018](https://www.scidatacon.org/conference/IDW2018/conference_themes_and_scope/):
- The digital frontiers of global science;
- a global and inclusive data revolution;
- applications, progress and challenges of data intensive research;
- data infrastructure and enabling practices for international and collaborative research.
