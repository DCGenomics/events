# What is the title of your talk?

Integrating the ecosystem of open science tools and infrastructure

# What is your talk about? (1 paragraph)

*Please supply one paragraph describing your talk and how it relates to the theme of Engagement. (Please also declare any conflicts of interest. )*

Just like the open science ecosystem itself, the underlying infrastructure is experiencing a period of rapid development and diversification. This creates challenges for anyone intending to use or build on such infrastructure and triggers the need for coordination. This session will outline how the Joint Roadmap for Open Science Tools is bringing together key technology organizations and researchers who are actively involved in the design and production of open scholarly infrastructure to explore shared goals and outcomes, develop cross-platform user stories, and identify areas of mutual collaboration. The talk will be given on the basis of https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/events/blob/master/FORCE-2018-jrost.md .
