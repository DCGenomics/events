# About

This file hosts my submission to the [FORCE11 Scholarly Communication Institute (FSCI)](https://www.force11.org/fsci) this summer (July 30 - August 3, 2018) in San Diego. It is based on an afternoon elective that was given during FSCI 2017 (see [notes](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/User:Daniel_Mietchen/FSCI_2017)) and will be evolving until FSCI 2018 and possibly beyond.

# Course title

- Integrating Wikidata with your research and curation workflows

# Describe the type of class you plan

FSCI has two types of courses. Long courses run in the morning Monday to Friday, for a total of 13-14 hours. Short courses run for two afternoon slots for a total of six hours on each of the Monday-Tuesday and/or Wednesday -Thursday. We expect most short courses to run twice.

# Abstract

[Wikidata](https://wikidata.org/) is becoming a [hub](https://tools.wmflabs.org/hub/) for structured data across a wide range of research fields, from [cultural](http://blogs.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/digital/author/poulterm/) [heritage](https://medium.com/@alexstinson/wikidata-in-collections-building-a-universal-language-for-connecting-glam-catalogs-59b14aa3214c) to [biomedicine](https://www.slideshare.net/andrewsu/bosc2017-using-wikidata-as-an-open-communitymaintained-database-of-biomedical-knowledge). Since it is also multilingual, it has been described as the [Rosetta stone of the linked open data age](http://lab.cccb.org/en/wikidata-the-new-rosetta-stone/).

This course aims to introduce participants to Wikidata and to highlight how it can and does contribute to workflows in or near the participants' fields of research. Prototyped at FSCI 2017, it builds on similar workshops given in the past to various audiences &mdash; from librarians to economists to scientists and museum professionals &mdash; on how research workflows can be integrated with Wikimedia workflows.

Since the launch of Wikidata in late 2012, the potential of integrating it with research and curation workflows has been explored through a number of activities, e.g. initiatives to collect on Wikidata information about [paintings](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_sum_of_all_paintings), [pathways](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/User:ProteinBoxBot/SPARQL_Examples#Wikidata_-%3E_Wikipathways), [politicians](https://www.mysociety.org/democracy/everypolitician/), [proteins](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/User:ProteinBoxBot/SPARQL_Examples#Uniprot_-%3E_Wikidata) or [publications](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/WikiCite) as well as [workshops](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_Ontology/Biocuration_2016) or [grant](https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.1.e7573) [proposals](http://sulab.org/2017/07/the-gene-wiki-project-looking-to-the-future-v-2017/).

The course consists of the following parts:
- the first morning is introductory and will provide the basics in terms of research and curation-related workflows on Wikimedia projects like Wikipedia, Wikimedia Commons, Wikisource and Wikidata;
- the second morning will zoom in on Wikidata and on extracting research-related information from it;
- the third morning will focus on participants contributing or otherwise curating some Wikidata content in their domains and languages of choice;
- the remainder of the course will explore how various aspects of Wikidata (e.g. Wikidata identifiers, APIs, SPARQL endpoint, multilinguality, the Wikibase software, apps and tools) can be integrated with research-related workflows, drawing on scenarios provided by course participants.

## Proposed level: 

- Beginner

## Any limits on participation

The course assumes no prerequisites other than some familiarity with research and curation workflows. Bringing a mobile Web-enabled device (e.g. laptop, tablet, smartphone) is strongly recommended.

Besides seats, tables and power outlets for everyone in the room, a stable WiFi would be needed, and for the speaker a projector and a stable Ethernet connection. Access to an A/V system would be beneficial but is not essential.

## Intended audience

- researchers and librarians from any field
- other curators of digital information
- anyone interested in workflows
- students of any of the above

## Contributions from the course to the Friday afternoon plenary session

Selected outputs from the course will be communicated to the full group of participants on the Friday afternoon. All participants of the course are encouraged to think about what that might be. Cross-fertilization with other courses they participate in &mdash; morning or afternoon, or even beyond FSCI &mdash; is highly encouraged.
