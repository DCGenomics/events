# About

The [10th International Conference on Ecological Informatics](http://icei2018.uni-jena.de/) is taking place on 24-28 September 2018 in Jena.

The call for proposals has an [April 15 deadline](http://icei2018.uni-jena.de/calls/), for which I am considering to submit the following abstract to the Session S3.2 "Citizen science meets informatics: Data science challenges in ecological research with public participation", as sketched out in [this ticket](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/events/issues/339). 

# Title of the abstract/talk

# Submission abstract

When searching the web for information on a given topic &mdash; say, citizen science &mdash; Wikipedia will often come up high in the search results. What is less known is that Wikipedia forms the nucleus of an entire ecosystem of Wikimedia projects that are roughly organized by information channel. Besides the encyclopedia, this includes an archive (Wikisource) and a dictionary (Wiktionary), along with sites dedicated to quotes (Wikiquote), taxa (Wikispecies), media files (Wikimedia Commons), books (Wikibooks), coursework (Wikiversity), news (Wikinews), structured data (Wikidata), software (MediaWiki) or technical infrastructure (Wikimedia Labs).

While citizen science-related topics form only a small sliver of the content found on these open knowledge platforms, the practice of contributing is similar to that of many citizen science projects: contributors are volunteers who participate in areas of their own interest, in a language of their choice and on their own timeline. The similarities go further, with community-driven collaborations forming around the identification of taxa, people or locations, around the collection and categorization of photographs, audiovisual materials and historic records, around the transcription and translation of such records, around the integration and vizualization of data, or around identifying and locating suitable resources that can help verify information related to any of the above.

This contribution is intended as a guided tour around citizen science activities taking place in the framework of Wikimedia projects, both within and across domains of knowledge. It will be organized on the basis of https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/events/blob/master/ICEI2018-citizen-science.md , which will provide further information ahead of the event. Participants are encouraged to bring their laptops, as they will be invited to actively engage with Wikimedia-based information in their domain, as well as to entertain and share ideas on how they could integrate it with their own activities.
