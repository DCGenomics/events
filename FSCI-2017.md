# About

This file hosts ideas about what I might contribute to the [FORCE11 Scholarly Communication Institute (FSCI)](https://www.force11.org/fsci) this summer. This document is evolving &mdash; see [this version](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/events/commit/4c2e05c48d104e6d32953c572f15000632ec8d5f#diff-e78435fc50601cd8eead924eb84c05fe) for the original submission.

# Afternoon Elective Course

Afternoon Elective Courses are six hours long and will be presented in three-hour sessions on consecutive afternoons (i.e. Monday-Tuesday and Wednesday-Thursday).

## Title

Integrating Wikidata with research and curation workflows

## Abstract

Wikidata is becoming a hub for structured data across a wide range of research fields, from cultural heritage ( cf. http://www.oxfordaspiremuseums.org/blog/wikidata ) to biomedicine (cf. http://blog.wikimedia.de/2014/10/22/establishing-wikidata-as-the-central-hub-for-linked-open-life-science-data/ ). Since it is also multilingual, it has been described as the  Rosetta stone of the linked open data age (cf. http://lab.cccb.org/en/wikidata-the-new-rosetta-stone/ ).

This workshop aims to introduce participants to Wikidata and to highlight how it can and does contribute to workflows in or near the participants' fields of research. It builds on similar workshops given in the past to various audiences &mdash; from librarians to economists to scientists and museum professionals &mdash; on how research workflows can be integrated with Wikimedia workflows (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Daniel_Mietchen/Talks/ for an overview and http://uksglive.blogspot.de/2015/04/daniel-mietchen-wikimedia-and-scholarly.html or
http://www.zew.de/en/das-zew/aktuelles/dr-daniel-mietchen-wikimedia-experte-fuer-open-science-spricht-beim-zew-research-seminar/ or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Daniel_Mietchen/Talks/ZBW_2013/Workshop
or http://www.eccb12.org/T6 for examples).

Since the launch of Wikidata in late 2012, the potential of integrating Wikidata with research and curation workflows has been explored through a number of activities, e.g. a grant proposal (cf. https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.1.e7573 ), several workshops (e.g.
https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_Ontology/Biocuration_2016 ) as well as initiatives to collect on Wikidata the metadata of scholarly references cited on Wikimedia projects (cf. 
https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/WikiCite ) or of all notable paintings (cf. https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_sum_of_all_paintings ).

The course would consist of two parts:
- the first afternoon is introductory and will provide the basics in terms of research and curation-related workflows on Wikidata;
- the second afternoon is more hands-on, focusing on integrating some exemplary discovery and curation workflows with Wikidata, which will be drawn from experiences shared by course participants.

## Proposed level: 

- Beginner

## Any limits on participation

The first part assumes no prerequisites other than some familiarity with research and curation workflows. Bringing a mobile Web-enabled device (e.g. laptop, tablet, smartphone) is recommended but not required.

Additional requirements for the second part are active participation in the first one, and bringing a Web-enabled device (ideally a laptop). 

Stable WiFi for everyone in the room would be needed, and for the speaker a projector and a stable Ethernet connection. Access to an A/V system would be beneficial but is not necessary.

## Intended audience

- researchers and librarians from any field
- curators of digital information
- anyone interested in workflows
- students of any of the above

## Contributions from the course to the Friday afternoon plenary session

Selected outputs from the Afternoon Courses will be communicated to the full group of participants on the Friday afternoon. All participants of the course are encouraged to think about what that might be. Cross-fertilization with other courses they participate in &mdash; morning or afternoon, or even beyond FSCI &mdash; is highly encouraged.

# Miscellaneous

The following topics are not part of this course but additional interests of mine that I invite FSCI participants to engage with.

* [publishing the research process (as opposed to just the results)](https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.1.e7547)
* [WikiCite](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/WikiCite)
* [organizing a doathon](https://github.com/sparcopen/Open-Research-doathon)
* [making Jupyter notebooks reproducible](https://github.com/sparcopen/open-research-doathon/issues/25)
* [machine-actionable DMPs](http://www.slideshare.net/StephanieSimms/making-dmps-actionable-and-public)
* policy hacking
* openness as a means to reduce bureaucracy
* [Making ethics data FAIR](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/events/blob/master/PIDapalooza.md)
