This file hosts ideas about what I might contribute to the [FORCE11 Scholarly Communication Institute (FSCI)](https://www.force11.org/fsci) this summer. I have submitted one proposal and considered submitting a few more.

# Submitted: Integrating Wikidata with research workflows

Wikidata is becoming a hub for structured data across a wide range of research fields, from cultural heritage ( cf. http://www.oxfordaspiremuseums.org/blog/wikidata ) to biomedicine (cf. http://blog.wikimedia.de/2014/10/22/establishing-wikidata-as-the-central-hub-for-linked-open-life-science-data/ ). Since it is also multilingual, it has been described as the  Rosetta stone of the linked open data age (cf. http://lab.cccb.org/en/wikidata-the-new-rosetta-stone/ ).

This workshop aims to introduce participants to Wikidata and to highlight how it can and does contribute to workflows in or near the participants' fields of research. It builds on similar workshops that I have given in the past to various audiences - from librarians to economists to scientists and museum professionals - on how research workflows can be integrated with Wikimedia workflows (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Daniel_Mietchen/Talks/ for an overview and http://uksglive.blogspot.de/2015/04/daniel-mietchen-wikimedia-and-scholarly.html or

or http://www.eccb12.org/T6 for examples).

Since the launch of Wikidata in late 2012, I have been exploring its potential in research contexts and (co-)organized a number of activities around this topic, e.g. a grant proposal (cf. https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.1.e7573 ), several workshops (e.g.
https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_Wikidata_for_research/Meetups/2015-02-23-Berlin ) as well as initiatives to collect on Wikidata the metadata of scholarly references cited on Wikimedia projects (most notably
https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/WikiCite ).

The closest precursor to the workshop I am proposing here is perhaps a 4h-workshop given last year at Biocuration (cf. 
https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_Ontology/Biocuration_2016 ). On that basis, the scope would be broadened to other disciplines, and I think it would be most useful to turn this into two half-day sessions - an introductory one that provides the basics and a more hands-on one that digs deeper into the specifics of the fields in which participants are active. Other arrangements in terms of timing are possible.

Stable WiFi for everyone in the room would be needed at least for the advanced part and would be very helpful for the introductory part as well. Likewise, participants would be advised to bring their laptops to the introductory part, and they would really need it for the advanced part.
