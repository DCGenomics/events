On September 14, 2015 in Berne, the [Swiss National Science Foundation](http://www.snf.ch/) are organizing a workshop on Open Data in Science, to which this document is a contribution.

# Title
A vision for Open Data at NIH

# Introduction

## What is NIH?
* [National Institutes of Health](http://nih.gov) in Bethesda, Maryland, USA
* a Federal Agency within the Department of Health and Human Services
* the world's largest biomedical research agency
* [NIH Mission](http://www.nih.gov/about/mission.htm)
* the [data science team](http://datascience.nih.gov/) (ADDS office)

# Sharing policies relevant to NIH

## At the Federal level
* [NIH Public Access Policy](http://publicaccess.nih.gov) (mandatory since April 2008)
   * supported by dedicated infrastructure, in particular [PubMed Central](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/)
   * [FAQ](http://publicaccess.nih.gov/FAQ.htm)
* Policy memorandum by John Holdren, Director of the White House [Office of Science and Technology Policy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ostp), ["direct[ing] Federal agencies with more than $100M in R&D expenditures to develop plans to make the results of federally funded research freely available to the public"](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/02/22/expanding-public-access-results-federally-funded-research). (Feb 2013)
* Executive Order by President Obama: [Making Open and Machine Readable the New Default for Government Information](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/09/executive-order-making-open-and-machine-readable-new-default-government-) (May 2013)
* Personalized Medicine Initiative
   * report of Working Group to be presented on Sep 17
* Congress bills 
* Blue button
* 508

## At the HHS level
* [Public Access](http://www.hhs.gov/open/publicaccess/index.html)
   * ["By ensuring that all publicly released research data is provided in open, machine-readable formats that can easily be accessed for computational analysis and machine-learning, it is our hope that we can help realize the promise of ‘big data’ in medicine and healthcare."](http://www.hhs.gov/idealab/2015/02/27/hhs-expands-approach-making-research-results-freely-available-public/) 
* [Common Rule](http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/commonrule/)
   * [US agencies plan research-ethics overhaul](http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1038/nature.2015.18309)
     * [advanced notice of proposed rulemaking](http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/anprmchangetable.html)
     * [detailed commentary](http://www.mwe.com/HHS-Releases-Highly-Anticipated-Proposal-to-Modernize-US-Human-Subjects-Research-Protections-09-08-2015/)

## At the NIH level
* [NIH Data Sharing Policy](http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/data_sharing/)
   * [NIH Model Organism Sharing Policy](http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/model_organism/)
   * [NIH Genomic Data Sharing Policy](https://gds.nih.gov/03policy2.html)
   * [Policy for Sharing of Data Obtained in NIH Supported or Conducted Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)](http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-07-088.html)
   * [The Cloud, dbGaP and the NIH](https://datascience.nih.gov/blog/cloud)
   * [Sex as a Biological Variable](http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-15-102.html)

# Outlook
* Public Access policies of other Federal agencies are being developed. Many of them explicitly build on the NIH experience with PubMed Central. They also refer to a "research data Commons".
* The Commons
* Future of NLM; recommendation for it to become a world leader in open science
* What about funders leading the research community by example in terms of being more open in the way they work?
   * Open data from funders might help research *about* research funding.
* public and machine readable data management plans
* [What would happen if grant reviews were made public?](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/517247f)
