# Background

## What is NIH?
* [National Institutes of Health](http://nih.gov) in Bethesda, Maryland, USA
* a Federal Agency within the Department of Health and Human Services
* the world's largest biomedical research agency
* [NIH Mission](http://www.nih.gov/about/mission.htm)
* the [data science team](http://datascience.nih.gov/) (ADDS office)

# Sharing policies relevant to NIH

## At the international level
* cross-disciplinary, e.g.
  * [Bethesda Statement on Open Access Publishing](http://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/bethesda.htm)
* field-specific, e.g. 
  * [Bermuda principles](http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/About-us/Policy/Policy-and-position-statements/WTD002751.htm) for human genome sequencing

## At the U.S. Federal level
* Policy memorandum by John Holdren, Director of the White House [Office of Science and Technology Policy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ostp), ["direct[ing] Federal agencies with more than $100M in R&D expenditures to develop plans to make the results of federally funded research freely available to the public"](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/02/22/expanding-public-access-results-federally-funded-research). (Feb 2013)
  * [SPARC overview of responses](http://www.sparc.arl.org/advocacy/national/directive) (regularly updated)
    * Apart from NIH, three agencies so far (AHRQ, NASA, NIST) opted for an approach based on PubMed Central for handling the literature part
  * [NIH policies on access and sharing](http://grants.nih.gov/grants/sharing.htm)
  * [NSF policy](http://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/public_access/)
  * several of these agencies envision a "research data commons"
* Executive Order by President Obama: [Making Open and Machine Readable the New Default for Government Information](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/09/executive-order-making-open-and-machine-readable-new-default-government-) (May 2013)

   * *Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI) Working Group [Report](http://acd.od.nih.gov/pmi.htm) to the Advisory Committee to the Director, NIH* to be published this week
* [Blue button](http://bluebuttonconnector.healthit.gov/)
* [Rehabilitation Act, Section 508](http://www.section508.gov/)

## At the HHS level
* [Public Access](http://www.hhs.gov/open/publicaccess/index.html)
   * ["By ensuring that all publicly released research data is provided in open, machine-readable formats that can easily be accessed for computational analysis and machine-learning, it is our hope that we can help realize the promise of ‘big data’ in medicine and healthcare."](http://www.hhs.gov/idealab/2015/02/27/hhs-expands-approach-making-research-results-freely-available-public/) 
* [Common Rule](http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/commonrule/)
   * [US agencies plan research-ethics overhaul](http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1038/nature.2015.18309)
     * [advanced notice of proposed rulemaking](http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/anprmchangetable.html)
     * [detailed commentary](http://www.mwe.com/HHS-Releases-Highly-Anticipated-Proposal-to-Modernize-US-Human-Subjects-Research-Protections-09-08-2015/)

## At the NIH level
* [NIH Public Access Policy](http://publicaccess.nih.gov) (mandatory since April 2008)
   * supported by dedicated infrastructure, in particular [PubMed Central](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/)
   * [FAQ](http://publicaccess.nih.gov/FAQ.htm)
* [NIH Data Sharing Policy](http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/data_sharing/)

  * also for software and other research outputs
* intramural/ extramural

## At [NIH Institutes and Centers](http://www.nih.gov/icd/)
* 27 of them, e.g. the National Library of Medicine (NLM)
* The [report on the strategic vision for the National Library of Medicine](http://acd.od.nih.gov/reports/Report-NLM-06112015-ACD.pdf) recommends that NLM should
   * "be a leader and innovator in open science efforts worldwide"
   * "lead efforts to support and catalyze open science, data sharing, and research reproducibility, striving to promote the concept that biomedical information and its transparent analysis are public"
   * and, in particular, "lead efforts to promulgate and implement best practices in open source, open science, standards, and data harmonization, forming partnerships across communities, stakeholder organizations, agencies, and countries" as well as "be an active participant in the design and oversight of programs that incentivize and celebrate the open sharing of data and resources."
