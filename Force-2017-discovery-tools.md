# Abstract

Open science enables new discovery tools and processes by providing open resources and an ever-growing digital infrastructure to build upon. However, we haven’t seen the paradigmatic change that has happened in other steps of the research cycle. In this workshop, we want to review the discovery workflow for an open science, and develop concrete recommendations for next steps. Through hands-on exercises using tools such as Scholia and Open Knowledge Maps, we will explore the emerging ecosystem around open discovery, define needs and requirements, and extract missing functionality and interoperability. Starting from the formally published research literature, we will look beyond and analyse the role and potential of grey literature as well as initiatives such as open annotation, data and software citation, collaborative reference management and resource identification for discovery.

With an emerging landscape of both commercial and non-profit offers, we will also discuss what it means to be open in terms of exploration and discovery. In addition, we will take a look at collaborative solutions for what is currently a mostly individualistic process. The outcome of the workshop will be a model for the discovery process in the age of open science, complete with a mapping of current and emerging practices and tools, as well as missing links and low-hanging fruits. With this, we want to set out a roadmap for open discovery for the immediate future.

# Schedule

#### 12:30 - 12:40 Welcome and warm-up

* **Exercise:** Get together in groups of two/three and discuss the following questions: How do you get an overview of a unknown research field? What are the problems and challenges that you are facing?

  * Record problems and challenges here: https://is.gd/force2017

#### 12:40 - 12:50 Introduction to discovery 

* **Presentation (Peter):**
  * Publication Feeds and BuRST: a personal story about discoverability
  * Dark knowledge - hidden in plain sight
  * Insights from a survey on discovery
  * Open Knowledge Maps and collaborative discovery

#### 12:50 - 13:00 Discovery in an open science

* **Presentation (Daniel):**
  * [Wikidata as a reference management platform](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/WikiCite)
  * [Scholia](https://tools.wmflabs.org/scholia/): resource discovery via SPARQL

#### 13:00 - 13:15 Discovery tools

* **Exercise:** In your group, inspect a discovery tool (sourced from e.g. 101 Innovations database) and rate it on several aspects of openness:
  * accessibility
  * source code
  * data
  * content
  * shareability of the results of the discovery process
  * annotation/comments
  * collaborative features
  * other

* Record your answers here: https://is.gd/force2017

#### 13:15 - 13:30 Open discovery workflow

* **Exercise:** Describe an open discovery scenario (a model workflow) for a typical discovery task, e.g.:
  * Getting an overview of a field
  * Collecting a body of evidence for a certain question
  * Keeping an overview of a field
  * ...

* Record the scenario here: https://is.gd/force2017
