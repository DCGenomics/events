# About
Many conferences and other events require submissions of proposals, but very few of these are being made public in a timely fashion or at all. Plus, many of these submission systems have technical issues or do not provide submitters with a copy of their submission. I have thus started this repo to keep track of my submissions to such closed systems, and I will also use it for hosting the materials for some invited talks.
