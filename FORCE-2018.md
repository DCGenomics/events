## Integrating the ecosystem of open science tools

Just like the open science ecosystem itself, the underlying infrastructure is experiencing a period of rapid development and diversification. This creates challenges for anyone intending to use or build on such infrastructure and triggers the need for coordination. This session will outline how the Joint Roadmap for Open Science Tools is bringing together key technology organizations and researchers who are actively involved in the design and production of open scholarly infrastructure to explore shared goals and outcomes, develop cross-platform user stories, and identify areas of mutual collaboration.

## 1-Minute madness

This session will consist of up to 25 lightning talks in which presenters can bring up any topic relevant to scholarly communication in just 1 min, with the discussion taking place in an accompanying etherpad.

## 1-Minute madness (remote)

Many who might have something valuable to contribute to the conference will not be able to make it in person. For this session, they will be invited to submit a 1-minute video or audio file that will be presented on site along with up to 24 others in a video medley.
