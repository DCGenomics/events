#About
This file hosts an abstract for the [International Meeting on Emerging Diseases and Surveillance (IMED 2016)](http://imed.isid.org/), which is to take place on 4-7 November, 2016, in Vienna, Austria. It was submitted to the "Public communication of outbreaks and emerging diseases" track on July 10 and received the abstract number 1124 in their system. On August 17, the abstract was accepted for the poster session. Upon confirming my attendance on September 16, I requested whether this contribution could be turned into a talk, and this was granted on September 18.

The talk is to be part of the session "Innovative Approaches to Emerging Disease Surveillance" at 8.30-10.30am on Monday, November 7, in Room Klimt 2&3.

#Title
Data sharing in public health emergencies

#Abstract

##Purpose
Public health emergencies caused by emerging diseases pose special challenges in terms of gathering relevant information and making it available to the research and public health communities as well as the public more broadly. In response, a growing number of initiatives are focusing on the role of data sharing under these circumstances.

##Methods & Materials
In this contribution, I am reviewing existing efforts around data sharing in recent public health emergencies from around the globe, focusing on cases where emerging diseases played a major role, as in the ongoing Zika virus outbreak. 

The underlying project is conducted by way of open notebook science that can be followed and contributed to via https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/datascience/blob/master/emergency-response.md .

##Results
Data sharing can increase the speed of responses to emerging diseases. It may also affect the quality, the nature or the range of the responses and other variables. Conversely, a lack of adequate data sharing may pose a considerable barrier to effective responses.

##Conclusion
Data sharing is becoming an important aspect of responses to public health emergencies, and strategies for communicating outbreaks and emerging diseases are evolving around this notion, complementing traditional means of research and public health communication with faster, more transparent, more collaborative and more responsive channels.

#Keywords
* Zika virus outbreak
* Ebola virus outbreak
* E. coli O104:H4 outbreak

#Affirmations
The submission process had two mandatory affirmations:
> Copyright (mandatory)
> By submission of this abstract I hereby confer the copyright for conference publication of all text and tables in this abstract to the organizers of the IMED 2016

> Authors confirmation (mandatory)
> I hereby confirm, that all authors mentioned in the author block of this abstract have been informed about, and agreed to this submission. 

I actually object to the transfer of copyright to the IMED organizers (and will try to submit without that statement clicked), but since my copy here is available earlier and under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/), there should in practice be no hurdle in terms of reuse of this text by others. In any case, this is work for the US government and as such not copyrightable in the US.

Update: they would indeed not let me submit the abstract without that confirmation. So I opted for submitting, took some screenshots in the process and sent them an email expressing my dissent with that point.

The [pump on Broad Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soho#Broad_Street_pump) was identified as the one through which the contaiminated water was distributed. Removing its handle then essentially stopped the outbreak, and when the next Cholera outbreak hit London in 1866, sanitary measures had been improved.

# About
This file hosts a contribution for [SciDataCon 2016](http://www.scidatacon.org/2016/) (11-13 September, 2016, in Denver, Colorado, U.S.), which was submitted on May 31 (submission ID 342). The [abstract](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/talks/blob/master/SciDataCon2016.md#abstract) has been accepted on July 7, and the talk has been included in the session [The Data requirements and availability for decision makers (ID 93)](http://www.scidatacon.org/2016/sessions/), which took place on September 12 from 9:30–11:00 am [MDT](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/mdt) as part of the *Data Reuse and Enhancement* track (see [program](http://www.scidatacon.org/2016/programme/)). The talk's time slot was ca. 10:14-10:26 am.

# Abstract
["Open data matters most when the stakes are high"](https://medium.com/@WhiteHouse/ten-years-after-katrina-new-orleans-recovery-and-what-data-had-to-do-with-it-3df0bb2467e9#.6fhghgjqe) – and what this means in the context of public health emergencies like the ongoing Zika virus outbreak.

# Background
Public health emergencies require profound and swift action at scale with limited resources, often on the basis of incomplete information and frequently under rapidly evolving circumstances. While donations of physical goods, personnel, financial aids and some other forms of emergency-triggered sharing go back millennia, data sharing is a relatively new facet of public health emergency responses. As our societies become ever more digital and globally connected, the profile of data is growing in many ways, and with it the potential impact of policies and practices around sharing and safeguarding data. 

# Fit to SciDataCon
The SciDataCon website states that “the most significant contemporary research challenges—and in particular those reaching across traditional disciplines—cannot be properly addressed without paying attention to issues relating to data”. 

With this contribution, I propose to present a range of contemporary research challenges related to major public health emergencies from around the globe and to highlight how the sharing or safeguarding of data and digital infrastructure affected the respective responses, particularly in ways that do not easily map to traditional disciplines.

The underlying project is conducted by way of open notebook science that can be followed and contributed to via [https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/datascience/blob/master/emergency-response.md](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/datascience/blob/master/emergency-response.md).

The talk itself will be given on the basis of [https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/talks/blob/master/SciDataCon2016.md](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/talks/blob/master/SciDataCon2016.md), which will be continuously expanded until the event takes place, and possibly thereafter.

# Competing Interests
The author works as a contractor for the National Institutes of Health, including on issues around data sharing in public health emergencies.

# Reviews
The following reviewer comments were transmitted to me on July 3 in response to the [original submission](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/talks/commit/79eedae0a112eefeba5e15ef941d79b48ea852cb). As I was on vacation at the time, I did not have time to incorporate them into the final conference paper (which was due on July 10, i.e. two months before the talk). I will take care of that in the coming weeks. In the meantime, I am including here a few quick responses to these comments.
> The paper has delve into important topic of data sharing in public health. But the paper should also provide further explanation about some of the challenges that are identified and possible solutions for data sharing. If the solution is not available, at least explaining the problem and how it is affecting the targetted sector will be helpful.

Yes, the talk will provide further detail. Will check how the session is going to be documented, and provide the information accordingly. As it happens, a paper with a very similar focus has since appeared ([Make Data Sharing Routine to Prepare for Public Health Emergencies](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1002109)), which provides some of the further details requested in this reviewer's comment.

> This paper discusses an important issue of data sharing in public health emergencies. The abstract, however, is not properly written, and there is no specific substance with regard to the approach or methodology taken in this paper.  This needs to be improved.

I have changed the abstract slightly. Not sure yet what to write in terms of methodology &mdash; so far, it has been little more than just [taking notes](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/datascience/blob/master/emergency-response.md) of relevant activities in the framework of the Zika response or as I saw them flow by in the news or in the literature. One of the purposes of the talk would be to get in contact with others who actually do research on such topics (so far, I haven't, but I am interested).

> This submission will discuss use cases for sharing data during public health disasters. If this will be a lightening talk for Session 93, then this seems appropriate to the session as this talk will address data sharing requirements in emergency situations. The information needs to be more clearly and robustly presented.

Yes, I will try to make it more clear and more robust, and I like lightning talks. On the other hand, I have enough material to fill the 10 min allocated to my part of the session.
