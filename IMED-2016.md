#About
This file hosts an abstract for the [International Meeting on Emerging Diseases and Surveillance (IMED 2016)](http://imed.isid.org/), which is to take place on 4-7 November, 2016, in Vienna, Austria. It was submitted to the "Public communication of outbreaks and emerging diseases" track on July 10 and received the abstract number 1124 in their system.

#Title
Data sharing in public health emergencies

#Abstract

##Purpose
Public health emergencies caused by emerging diseases pose special challenges in terms of gathering relevant information and making it available to the research and public health communities as well as the public more broadly. In response, a growing number of initiatives are focusing on the role of data sharing under these circumstances.

##Methods & Materials
In this contribution, I am reviewing existing efforts around data sharing in recent public health emergencies from around the globe, focusing on cases where emerging diseases played a major role, as in the ongoing Zika virus outbreak. 

The underlying project is conducted by way of open notebook science that can be followed and contributed to via https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/datascience/blob/master/emergency-response.md .

##Results
Data sharing can increase the speed of responses to emerging diseases. It may also affect the quality, the nature or the range of the responses and other variables. Conversely, a lack of adequate data sharing may pose a considerable barrier to effective responses.

##Conclusion
Data sharing is becoming an important aspect of responses to public health emergencies, and strategies for communicating outbreaks and emerging diseases are evolving around this notion, complementing traditional means of research and public health communication with faster, more transparent, more collaborative and more responsive channels.

#Affirmations
The submission process had two mandatory affirmations:
> Copyright (mandatory)
> By submission of this abstract I hereby confer the copyright for conference publication of all text and tables in this abstract to the organizers of the IMED 2016

> Authors confirmation (mandatory)
> I hereby confirm, that all authors mentioned in the author block of this abstract have been informed about, and agreed to this submission. 

I actually object to the transfer of copyright to the IMED organizers (and will try to submit without that statement clicked), but since my copy here is available earlier and under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/), there should in practice be no hurdle in terms of reuse of this text by others.

Update: they would indeed not let me submit the abstract without that confirmation. So I opted for submitting, took some screenshots in the process and will send them an email expressing my dissent with that point.
