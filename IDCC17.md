This file is a contribution to the [12th International Digital Curation Conference (IDCC17)](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/drupal/events/idcc17) taking place in Edinburgh on 20 - 23 February 2017, and specifically its Workshop 1, "[A postcard from the future: tools and services from a perfect DMP world](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/events/idcc17/workshops#workshop1)".

The workshop organisers have asked participants for various input beforehand, including responses to the following three questions:

 1. Why are you motivated / excited / required to work on data management / DMPs? 

 1. What are your pain points? 
 
 1. What do you hope to get out of this workshop?
