# About

This file hosts my session proposal for [PIDapalooza 2018](https://doi.org/10.5438/11.0002). It was submitted on September 22, 2017, which was the extended [submission deadline](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/events/issues/208). On October 11, I was notified that the proposal had been accepted.

# Title

PIDs for policy elements

# Abstract

Policies are a common way to structure interactions amongst humans as well as between humans and human-made systems. In turn, they have a structure to themselves, which may vary considerably across use cases but can generally be broken down into individual policy elements. In this session - which will be presented from https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/events/blob/master/PIDapalooza-2018.md - we will entertain the idea of assigning PIDs to such policy elements and explore the effects that might have on 
- exposing policies relevant to a given context, 
- flagging contradictions between policies, 
- building policy-aware workflows, 
- monitoring policy compliance, and 
- standardizing policies across languages, jurisdictions and other use cases.
