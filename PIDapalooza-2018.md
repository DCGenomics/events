# Title

PIDs for policy elements

# Abstract

Policies are a common way to structure interactions amongst humans as well as between humans and human-made systems. In turn, they have a structure to themselves, which may vary considerably across use cases but can generally be broken down into individual policy elements. In this session, we will entertain the idea of assigning PIDs to such policy elements and explore the effects that might have on exposing policies relevant to a given context, flagging contradictions between policies, building policy-aware workflows, monitoring policy compliance, and standarizing policies across languages and jurisdictions.
