# Title

PIDs for policy elements

# Abstract

Policies are a common way to structure interactions amongst humans as well as between humans and human-made systems. In turn, they have a structure to themselves, which may vary considerably across use cases but can generally be broken down into individual policy elements. In this session - which will be presented from https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/events/blob/master/PIDapalooza-2018.md - we will entertain the idea of assigning PIDs to such policy elements and explore the effects that might have on exposing policies relevant to a given context, flagging contradictions between policies, building policy-aware workflows, monitoring policy compliance, and standardizing policies across languages, jurisdictions and other use cases.
