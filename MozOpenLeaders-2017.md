This file hosts the free-text parts of my application for [MozOpenLeaders 2017](https://medium.com/read-write-participate/are-you-building-in-the-open-join-forces-with-mozilla-a791dbb5c74b) (the rest were basically multiple-choice questions or about personal information). It was [submitted](https://twitter.com/EvoMRI/status/817180729432018944) on January 6, 2017, to a January 20th deadline.

# Your Project

> Tell us about your open project!

> The project doesnâ€™t have to be technical! It can be curriculum (open educational resource), an open data project or report, an open source software project, or anything else that has:

> 1. a way for others to get involved
> 2. a feature, release, or MVP (minimum viable product) to work on publicly with community members for the duration of the program

# Project Name

WikiProject Open Access

# Project Description

Leveraging the open-access literature in the context of Wikimedia projects

# What problem(s) are you solving with this project?

Integrating information from open-access resources into Wikimedia projects (especially Wikipedias, Wikisources, Wikimedia Commons and Wikidata), i.e. locations and languages that people (and, increasingly, machines) use to look for such information; making readers aware of the openness of such information; curate bibliographic metadata of open-access publications.

# What feature, release, or product can you work on during the program?
> March - June 2017

A Wikidata-based open bibliography of open-access articles cited on Wikimedia projects as a basis for new mechanisms for knowledge discovery, scientific collaboration and research assessment (demos at https://tools.wmflabs.org/scholia/venue/Q564954 or https://tools.wmflabs.org/scholia/topic/Q202864 or https://tools.wmflabs.org/scholia/publisher/Q463494 ).

# How can others join you on this project?

Multiple ways, e.g. https://github.com/wpoa or https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Open_Access_Media_Importer_Bot or https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_Source_MetaData or https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/WikiCite .

# Why do you want to work open?

Every day makes me aware of the limitations of my knowledge, skills and resources. When these limitations stand in the way of moving forward, working openly makes it much easier to bring in others, including people who I neither know personally nor via my network.

# What challenges have you faced working open?
> OR what has kept you from working open

Lots, e.g. non-open or unclear licensing of the things I'd like to work with; non-open formats; incomplete or inaccurate metadata; inconsistent usage of standards; conservative colleagues and institutional inertia.

# Is there anything else you'd like us to know?

I am interested in ways in which technology could be leveraged in the context of open knowledge projects. While an experienced contributor to open knowledge projects (e.g. https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Daniel_Mietchen/European_Commission_Open_Science_Policy_Platform or http://sparcopen.org/our-work/innovator/ or https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/open-science-prize ) and a mentor on matters of open science (e.g. https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Deutschland/Open_Science_Fellows_Program ), I have rather limited coding skills (cf. https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/learning2code ) and would like to tap into the technical expertise at Mozilla to guide my learning process here in a way that helps advance the open projects that I am engaging with. 

Information on Wikimedia and Open Access is summarized in https://blog.wikimedia.org/2014/01/15/wikimedia-and-open-access/ , with monthly updates in https://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:This_Month_in_GLAM_Open_Access_reports .

I participated in past MozSprints. In 2016, I had suggested a project (cf. https://github.com/mozillascience/global-sprint-2016/issues/53 ) but did not find others who wanted to join in, so I contributed to a related project (cf. https://github.com/mozillascience/global-sprint-2016/issues/36 ).

My application is also available via https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/talks/blob/master/MozOpenLeaders-2017.md .
