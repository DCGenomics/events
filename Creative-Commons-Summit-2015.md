# Session title
Rethinking open research policies

# Abstract
Open access mandates and declarations, requirements for data management plans and related policy instruments have had considerable impact on the way research results are communicated between researchers, institutions and with the public. They have had much less of an effect on how research is being performed and how the research process is being shared. Based on an analysis of shortcomings in existing policies, I will outline some ways in which we could increase their individual and collective impact.

# Detailed description
Typical problems with existing policies include that they:
 1. are hard to translate to or from concrete actions;
 2. are not coupled with technical means facilitating their implementation;
 3. contain stipulations that are based on assumptions rather than data;
 4. focus on research results, often ignoring the process leading to them;
 5. focus on regulating researchers, rather than empowering them;
 6. neglect the importance of reuse rights;
 7. are not openly licensed themselves.

In this presentation, I will 
 1. explain why these problems are actually problems;
 2. highlight policy examples that address them in a promising way;
 3. outline how we could build on those examples to increase the individual and collective impact of open research policies.
