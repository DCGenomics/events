# About

The European Citizen Science Association (ECSA) are holding their next [conference](https://www.ecsa-conference.eu/) on 3-5 June 2018 in Geneva.

The call for proposals had a [deadline of tonight](https://www.ecsa-conference.eu/component/k2/item/15-the-call-is-extended), by which I submitted four abstracts, three of which have a dedicated entry in this repo:
* [Citizen science and open science would benefit from closer interaction](ECSA-2018-Citizen-science-and-Open-science.md)
* [Wikimedia projects and their communities interact with citizen science in multiple ways](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/User:Daniel_Mietchen/ECSA_2018)
* [A framework for co-creating citizen science projects with school students](ECSA-2018-IAS.md)
* [Usability of citizen science projects](ECSA-2018-Usability.md)
