The European Citizen Science Association (ECSA) are holding their next [conference](https://www.ecsa-conference.eu/) on 3-5 June 2018 in Geneva.

The call for proposals had a [January 21 deadline](https://www.ecsa-conference.eu/component/k2/item/15-the-call-is-extended), by which I submitted four abstracts, three of which have a dedicated entry in this repo:
* [Citizen science and open science would benefit from closer interaction](ECSA-2018-Citizen-science-and-Open-science.md) (on March 28, I was notified that this session had been accepted, albeit in a format that differed from what I had proposed. I confirmed by the April 4 deadline)
* [Wikimedia projects and citizen science](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/User:Daniel_Mietchen/ECSA_2018) (on March 28, I was notified that this session had been accepted, albeit in a format that differed from what I had proposed. I confirmed by the April 4 deadline)
* [A framework for co-creating citizen science projects with school students](ECSA-2018-IAS.md) (waitlisted as of March 27)
* [Usability of citizen science projects](ECSA-2018-Usability.md) (on March 27, I was notified that this session was not to be included in the final program)
