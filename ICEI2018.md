# About

The [10th International Conference on Ecological Informatics](http://icei2018.uni-jena.de/) is taking place on 24-28 September 2018 in Jena.

The call for proposals has an [April 15 deadline](http://icei2018.uni-jena.de/calls/), for which I am considering to submit several abstracts, as sketched out in [this ticket](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/events/issues/339). I will use this file to develop these ideas further.
