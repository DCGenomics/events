The [10th International Conference on Ecological Informatics](http://icei2018.uni-jena.de/) is taking place on 24-28 September 2018 in Jena.

The call for proposals had an [April 15 deadline](http://icei2018.uni-jena.de/calls/), by which I submitted several abstracts, as sketched out below and in [this ticket](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/events/issues/339).
