# About

The [10th International Conference on Ecological Informatics](http://icei2018.uni-jena.de/) is taking place on 24-28 September 2018 in Jena.

The call for proposals has an [April 15 deadline](http://icei2018.uni-jena.de/calls/), for which I am considering to submit several abstracts, as sketched out in [this ticket](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/events/issues/339). I will use this file to develop these ideas further.

# Potential submissions

## Session S1.6 Semantics for biodiversity and ecosystem research

## Submission title

Visualizing the research ecosystem of ecosystem research via Wikidata


## Submission abstract

Research takes place in a sociotechnical ecosystem that connects researchers, institutions, funders, publications, methods and related concepts with the objects of study and the world around them. Schemas to describe such concepts are growing in breadth and depth, number and popularity, as are mechanisms to persistently and uniquely identify the concepts, the schemas, their relationships or any of their components.
