My notes on the event sit at https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/events/issues/338 . I will also keep an eye on the [#ICEI2018](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=ICEI2018) hashtag.

# History

The call for proposals had an [April 15 deadline](http://icei2018.uni-jena.de/calls/), by which I submitted the abstracts to the above sessions, as sketched out in [this ticket](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/events/issues/339).
