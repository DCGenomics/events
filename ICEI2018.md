# About

The [10th International Conference on Ecological Informatics](http://icei2018.uni-jena.de/) is taking place on 24-28 September 2018 in Jena.

The call for proposals has an [April 15 deadline](http://icei2018.uni-jena.de/calls/), for which I am considering to submit several abstracts, as sketched out in [this ticket](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/events/issues/339). I will use this file to develop these ideas further.

# Potential submissions

## Session S1.6 Semantics for biodiversity and ecosystem research

## Submission title

Visualizing the research ecosystem of ecosystem research via Wikidata


## Submission abstract


Like research in general, biodiversity and ecosystem research takes place in a sociotechnical ecosystem that connects researchers, institutions, funders, publications, methodologies and related concepts with the objects of study and the world around them. Schemas for describing such concepts are growing in breadth and depth, number and popularity, as are mechanisms to persistently and uniquely identify the concepts, the schemas, their relationships or any of their components. In parallel, more and more data &mdash; and particularly metadata &mdash; are being made available under open licenses, which facilitates discoverability, reproducibility and reuse, as well as data integration.

Wikidata is a community-curated open knowledgebase in which concepts covered in any Wikipedia &mdash; and beyond &mdash; can be described in a structured fashion and queried using SPARQL and various other means. Its community of about 20,000 monthly contributors oversees a corpus that currently comprises about 50 million 'items', i.e. entries about concepts. These items are annotated and linked via about 5000 'properties' that describe relationships between items or between items and external entities or that express specific value. The items and properties have persistent unique identifiers, to which labels and descriptions can be attached in about 300 natural languages. Besides taxa, geomorphological features, chemical compounds or ecological interactions, Wikidata also contains information about researchers and many components of their research ecosystems, including a growing body of publications, particularly in the life sciences.

A range of open-source tools is available to interact with Wikidata &mdash; to enter information, curate and query it. One of them is Scholia &mdash; a frontend to Wikidata's SPARQL endpoint &mdash; that can be used to explore research publications and how they relate to authors, institutions, funders and other parts of the research ecosystem, as well as to taxa, metabolic networks, or geolocations.


Missing points
- link to session
- link to biodiversity and ecosystem research
- open data
- data integration
- Wikidata
- multilingual
- taxon names vs. commons names
- Wikibase
- games, e.g. file candidates
- Scholia
- taxa, habitats and nature of ecological interactions
- validation
- SDGs
- Each of these items has a persistent unique identifier, e.g. Q52105 for 'habitat'. The items are annotated and linked via about 5000 'properties' (likewise with persistent identifiers) that describe relationships between items &mdash; e.g. P171, 'parent taxon' &mdash; or between items and external entities &mdash; e.g. Mount Kilimanjaro (Q7296) has the Smithsonian volcano ID (P1886) of '222150' &mdash; or that express specific values, e.g. that *Antilope cervicapra* (Q183339) has an average gestation period (P3063) of 5-6 months.
