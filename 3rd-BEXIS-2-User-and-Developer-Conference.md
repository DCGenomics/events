# About

This file is a contribution to the [3rd BEXIS 2 User and Developer Conference](http://fusion.cs.uni-jena.de/bexis2userdevconf2017/) taking place on 16 June 2017 in Jena, with an associated workshop on June 15. BEXIS (also BExIS) stands for "[Biodiversity Exploratories Information System](https://www.bexis.uni-jena.de/)" and is a research environment for managing the entire data life cycle for biodiversity data. I was invited to give a talk there, which will be presented from this page on June 15 at 7am UTC.

# Title 

Opening up the research data life cycle

# Abstract

More and more aspects of the research data life cycle involve some
form of sharing - be it the protocols used to generate the data, the
software to analyze it, metadata about the data, the data itself or
other aspects of its life cycle, from ethical review to citizen
science. This talk zooms in on some examples in different stages of
different data life cycles and explores how the changing dynamics of
data sharing interact with the dynamics of doing research more
generally. The presentation will be given on the basis of https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/events/blob/master/3rd-BEXIS-2-User-and-Developer-Conference.md .
