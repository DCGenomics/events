# About

This file hosts the basis for a talk to be given on February 26, 2018 at 3pm ET in the Alderman Library, Room 421, University of Virginia. It is a [contribution](http://endangereddataweek.org/events/2018-02-26-data-sharing-in-public-health-energencies/) to a [series of events](http://data.library.virginia.edu/endangered-data-week-2018/) organized at the University of Virginia in the framework of [Endangered Data Week](http://endangereddataweek.org/) 2018. 

# Title

Data sharing and public health emergencies

# Abstract

Public health emergencies require profound and swift action at scale with limited resources, often on the basis of incomplete information and frequently under rapidly evolving circumstances. While emergency-triggered sharing goes back millennia, data sharing is a relatively new facet of public health emergency responses. As our societies become ever more digital and globally connected, the profile of data is growing in many ways, and with it the potential impact of preserving and sharing data, or failing at that.

The talk will be given on the basis of [https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/events/blob/master/Endangered-Data-Week-UVA-2018.md](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/events/blob/master/Endangered-Data-Week-UVA-2018.md), which will be continuously expanded until the event takes place, and possibly thereafter.
