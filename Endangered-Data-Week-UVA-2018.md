# Abstract

Public health emergencies require profound and swift action at scale with limited resources, often on the basis of incomplete information and frequently under rapidly evolving circumstances. While emergency-triggered sharing goes back millennia, data sharing is a relatively new facet of public health emergency responses. As our societies become ever more digital and globally connected, the profile of data is growing in many ways, and with it the potential impact of preserving and sharing data, or failing at that.

The talk will be given on the basis of [https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/events/blob/master/Endangered-Data-Week-UVA-2018.md](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/events/blob/master/Endangered-Data-Week-UVA-2018.md), which will be continuously expanded until the event takes place, and possibly thereafter.

## [1854: Cholera, London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1854_Broad_Street_cholera_outbreak)
![Map of 1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Snow-cholera-map-1.jpg)

[John Snow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Snow)'s [original map](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Snow-cholera-map-1.jpg) of the [1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak in London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1854_Broad_Street_cholera_outbreak). Cholera cases are highlighted in black, as are water pumps (data available [here](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/mar/15/john-snow-cholera-map#data)). The [pump on Broad Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soho#Cholera_outbreak) was identified as the one through which the contaiminated water was distributed. Removing its handle then essentially stopped the outbreak, and when the next Cholera outbreak hit London in 1866, sanitary measures had been improved.

* Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID)
  * [paper](http://doi.org/10.1038/442981a)
    - > to understand better the spread and evolution of the virus, and the determinants of its transmissibility and pathogenicity in humans [..] demands that scientists with different fields of expertise have full access to comprehensive genetic-sequence, clinical and epidemiological data from both animal and human virus isolates.
    - > The current level of collection and sharing of data is inadequate, however, given the magnitude of the threat. 
    - > We propose to expand and complement existing efforts with the creation of a global consortium — the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID; http://gisaid.org) — that would foster international sharing of avian influenza isolates and data.

* [Partnerships, Not Parachutists, for Zika Research](http://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMp1602278):
  * "But we believe the experience with recent outbreaks makes clear that if open sharing of data and specimens becomes the norm among scientists and epidemiologists around the world, we will be far more likely to succeed in improving international public health capacity and strengthening our collective health — and human — security. 
  * To avoid having to make this argument again every time we face an outbreak with the potential for becoming a global crisis, we believe the global health community should develop and agree on a framework of principles for sharing data and biologic samples during any such public health emergency. It would be best if the researchers themselves developed such a framework, as the genomics community did in the Human Genome Project."
