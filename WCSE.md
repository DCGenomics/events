##Abstract
Research is the process of systematically collecting information to expand the boundaries of scholarly knowledge. With the ongoing transition towards digital and Web-based research communication, the scholarly record has broadened in scope to include data, software and other research artifacts. Conversely, the Web has given rise to new forms of scholarship that transcend traditional boundaries between disciplines, jurisdictions, economic sectors or professional and amateur researchers.[1] 
A key enabler of these new forms of scholarship is sharing: more research is shared more widely and more openly now than just a decade ago.[2] On the other hand, the incentive structures in academia – both globally and in Korea – are heavily biased against broad and open sharing.
In this contribution, I will examine examples of such open and sharing-enabled scholarship –  like the Polymath Projects [3] in mathematics, the FoldIt project [4] in structural biology, the Zooniverse projects [5] in astronomy, the Praziquantel project [6] in drug discovery or the genome annotation of the 2011 E. coli O104:H4 outbreak [7] – to highlight factors that determine the success of such projects from the perspective of the different stakeholders as well as society as a whole. I will end by exploring the implications for research communication [8] as well as research policy [9].
