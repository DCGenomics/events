Research published over the last week

# What is your talk about? (1 paragraph)

*Please supply one paragraph describing your talk and how it relates to the theme of Engagement. (Please also declare any conflicts of interest. )*

With thousands of research publications coming out each day, it is hard to keep or even get an overview. I will provide a guided tour around research that was published over the week prior to the session, highlighting (i) how to find such publications (ii) what can be learned from them in such a short time span and (iii) how this can inform future behaviour of authors, readers, publishers and others engaged in scholarly communication.
