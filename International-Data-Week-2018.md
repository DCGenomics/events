[International Data Week 2018](http://internationaldataweek.org/programme-overview) combines a number of events around data, particularly research data.

I am mainly involved in two of them:
- [SciDataCon 2018](https://www.scidatacon.org/IDW2018/programme/)
  - see my notes on this at [SciDataCon-2018.md](SciDataCon-2018.md)
- [12th Plenary of the Research Data Alliance](http://www.internationaldataweek.org/rda-12th-plenary)
