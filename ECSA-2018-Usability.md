# About

This file hosts a submission to the European Citizen Science Association (ECSA) [conference](https://www.ecsa-conference.eu/) on 3-5 June 2018 in Geneva. It was submitted by the 21 January 2018 deadline under the "Empowering (individual) citizens" theme and the subtheme "Contributory, collaborative, co-created and collegiate – How to understand and conceptualize the role of participants in the spectrum of Citizen Science – from bottom-up to top-down? What are the specific challenges for citizens?"

On March 27, I was notified that this session was not to be included in the final program.

# Title

Usability of citizen science projects

# Abstract

This session aims to encourage its participants to try out citizen science projects of their choice, on their own laptops or other mobile devices. They will be prompted to assess the usability of the tested projects via a lightweight survey, and for a small number of specific projects (to be selected on the basis of the other sessions that make it into the program), representatives will be there to help deepen the interaction between the projects and these new test users.

The main goals of the session - which is to be given on the basis of https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/events/blob/master/ECSA-2018-Usability.md - are to provide conference participants with a hands-on experience of citizen science projects new to them, and to provide organizers of citizen science projects with feedback on usability. An intended side effect of the preparation of the session is the creation of a simplified way to assess citizen science projects in terms of their usability by new users.
