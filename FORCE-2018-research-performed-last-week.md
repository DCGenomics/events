Research performed over the last week

# What is your talk about? (1 paragraph)

*Please supply one paragraph describing your talk and how it relates to the theme of Engagement. (Please also declare any conflicts of interest. )*

Research is performed every day, but much of it is hidden from public view. I will provide a guided tour around public aspects of research from various fields that was performed over the week prior to the session, highlighting (i) how to find such research, (ii) what can be learned from it, (iii) how to engage with it and (iv) lessons that can be drawn from the experience. The talk will be given on the basis of https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/events/blob/master/FORCE-2018-research-performed-last-week.md .

# Anything else we should know? 

This talk is closely related with the one at https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/events/blob/master/FORCE-2018-research-published-last-week.md , and I would strongly prefer the two to be scheduled back to back in the same room, either before a session covering scholarly communication more broadly, or before a break.
