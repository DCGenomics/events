# Title

Data sharing in public health emergencies

# Session description

Humanity has a long history of sharing, especially in the wake of disasters. Data sharing is a relatively new flavour under this broader theme, but one that has been receiving attention over the last few years, especially in the context of public health emergencies like the Ebola or Zika outbreaks. 

In response, researchers, research institutions, journals, funders and others have taken steps towards increasing the sharing of data around public health emergencies. These measures range from the adoption of open lab notebooks to modifications of policies and funding lines, and they include conversations around infrastructure and cultural change. 

In this session, representatives from various stakeholder groups are invited to contribute their perspectives in a series of lightning talks, highlighting steps that have already been taken as well as challenges still lying ahead.

Together, these talks - and the ensuing discussion - are to span the entire data life cycle of public health emergencies, from preventive measures and routine public health surveillance data to the tracking of pathogens, investigating pathogen transmission and other host-pathogen interactions, as well as diagnostics, vaccination, epidemiological modelling and other related efforts.

This submission addresses all four of the high-level themes of SciDataCon 2018:
- The digital frontiers of global science;
- a global and inclusive data revolution;
- applications, progress and challenges of data intensive research;
- data infrastructure and enabling practices for international and collaborative research.
