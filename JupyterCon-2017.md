After submitting these, you will then be asked to input the speaker details.

Please let us know if you have any special equipment needs for your presentation.

(Note: Each presentation room will have a podium, projector, 16:9 screen, head table, microphone, ethernet connection for speaker, and wifi.)
Video URL

While not compulsory, we strongly encourage you to provide at least one video clip of the speaker. If you don’t have video of the speaker in action at an event, please create a very short clip (2-3 minutes, see examples) proposing the session. We don’t care about the quality of the video; we care about the quality of the speakers. If your video isn’t already online, post it to a third-party site (YouTube is fine), and then share the link with us.
O'Reilly Author

If you are an author or content contributor at O’Reilly, please fill in the name of your main O’Reilly editorial contact.
Did someone recommend or encourage you to submit a proposal?

If so, please let us know who sent you:
Diversity *

Diversity is one of the factors we seriously consider when reviewing proposals as we seek to broaden our speaker roster.

Does your presentation have the participation of a woman, person of color, person with disabilities, or member of another group often underrepresented at tech conferences?
Travel & other expense reimbursements *

If your proposal is chosen, would you need assistance with hotel or travel related expenses (for example, because you are self-employed)? Please note: Your answer to this question will have no impact on the committee’s review of your proposal.
If so, please describe.
Additional notes

Any other information you would like the program committee and/or conference organizers to know?
Code of Conduct

All participants, including speakers and presenters, must follow our Code of Conduct, the core of which is this: JupyterCon should be a safe and productive environment for everyone.

By submitting a proposal, I (and any other presenters included in this speaking proposal) agree to follow the [conference Code of Conduct](https://conferences.oreilly.com/jupyter/jup-ny/public/content/conduct). Read more »
