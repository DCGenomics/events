On September 14, 2015, the [Swiss National Science Foundation](http://www.snf.ch/) are organizing a workshop on Open Data in Science, to which this document is a contribution.

# Title
A vision for Open Data at NIH

# Introduction

## What is NIH?
* [National Institutes of Health](http://nih.gov) in Bethesda, Maryland, USA
* a Federal Agency within the Department of Health and Human Services
* [NIH Mission](http://www.nih.gov/about/mission.htm)

# Sharing policies relevant to NIH

## At the Federal level
* [NIH Public Access Policy](http://publicaccess.nih.gov) (mandatory since April 2008)
   * supported by dedicated infrastructure, in particular [PubMed Central](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/)
   * [FAQ](http://publicaccess.nih.gov/FAQ.htm)
* Policy memorandum by John Holdren, Director of the White House [Office of Science and Technology Policy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ostp), ["direct[ing] Federal agencies with more than $100M in R&D expenditures to develop plans to make the results of federally funded research freely available to the public"](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/02/22/expanding-public-access-results-federally-funded-research). (Feb 2013)
* Executive Order by President Obama: [Making Open and Machine Readable the New Default for Government Information](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/09/executive-order-making-open-and-machine-readable-new-default-government-) (May 2013)
* Congress bills 

## At the NIH level
* [The Cloud, dbGaP and the NIH](https://datascience.nih.gov/blog/cloud)
* Sex as a variable

# Outlook
* Public Access policies of other Federal agencies are being developed. Many of them explicitly build on the NIH experience with PubMed Central.
* public and machine readable data management plans
