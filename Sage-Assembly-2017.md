# About

On April 20-22, the [2017 Sage Assembly](http://sageassembly.org/?page_id=13) is taking place in Seattle. In preparation for the event, the organizers have asked for a "Link to your work that best fits the Assembly", which will be linked from the [list of participants](http://sageassembly.org/?page_id=48). I think the best way to address that is to set up a dedicated document here that I can update before, during and possibly after the Assembly, whose theme this year is "Mapping Open Research Ecosystems".

From the [homepage](http://sageassembly.wpengine.com/):
> In 2017, we will bring the Assembly to Seattle, Sage Bionetworks’ home base, and back to the themes closest to us: open innovation in science, and the acceleration of health research through open systems, incentives and  standards.  Together, we will explore how open ecosystems form, where they work, and what boundaries are necessary to operate them successfully. We will also address the consequences, intended or otherwise, of living in more open ways. As always you can expect the unexpected at a Sage Assembly – with a focus on participant interaction, engaging panels, lots of interaction, and an afternoon outside the venue where we will work in teams on projects that explore our themes in non-traditional ways.

# 3-min talks

The organizers invited me to contribute to "a series of talks in a rapid-learning format with each speaker providing a three minute talk on their work and experience as they relate to the themes of the Assembly".

# Demo

The organizers also invited suggestions for demos of up to 15 min. I had suggested to demo Wikimedia-based open research workflows, i.e. how Wikimedia platforms can be used to cover a broad range of digital research workflows in a wide array of disciplines (see [here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Daniel_Mietchen/Talks/UKSG_2015) for a talk covering part of this topic), but this suggestion was not taken.
