# About

On April 20-22, the [2017 Sage Assembly](http://sageassembly.org/?page_id=13) is taking place in Seattle. In preparation for the event, the organizers have asked for a "Link to your work that best fits the Assembly". I think the best way to address that is to set up a dedicated document here that I can update before, during and possibly after the Assembly, whose theme this year is "Mapping Open Research Ecosystems".

From the [homepage](http://sageassembly.wpengine.com/):
> In 2017, we will bring the Assembly to Seattle, Sage Bionetworks’ home base, and back to the themes closest to us: open innovation in science, and the acceleration of health research through open systems, incentives and  standards.  Together, we will explore how open ecosystems form, where they work, and what boundaries are necessary to operate them successfully. We will also address the consequences, intended or otherwise, of living in more open ways. As always you can expect the unexpected at a Sage Assembly – with a focus on participant interaction, engaging panels, lots of interaction, and an afternoon outside the venue where we will work in teams on projects that explore our themes in non-traditional ways.

# Demo

The organizers also invited suggestions for demos of up to 15 min. I would like to demo Wikimedia-based open research workflows.
